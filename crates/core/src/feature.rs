// The contract between the app and a feature (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2, §6).
//
// A feature is one object implementing `Feature`. The app owns the list
// (src-tauri/src/registry.rs), calls `start` when the feature is switched on
// and `stop` when it is switched off or the app quits, and routes every command
// of the feature through `call`. `Ctx` is everything a feature may ask of the
// app: its own settings, events, a data folder, windows and the pause flag.
